{{ content | trim }} <image>
First, analyze the input image, think about how to convert it into SVG format, then generate SVG code that would render the image exactly as you see it. The SVG should have dimensions of 512x512 pixels (width="512" height="512"). Think about the key shapes, paths, and visual elements that need to be represented and their x/y coordinates within this 512x512 canvas and match it exactly.

Formatting:
Your reasoning process MUST BE enclosed within <think></think> tags, immediately followed by <answer><svg width="512" height="512" ...></svg></answer> tags containing the final SVG code or you will not receive any credit.
